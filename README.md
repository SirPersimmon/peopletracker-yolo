# People Tracker with YOLO

People Tracker with YOLO is a simple Python Application made for a university assignment. This application analyzes
video files and returns videos with information about the number of people in them and when each person was in frame. It
provides an API and a Web interface made with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Tracking features are heavily based on
[YOLOv7-DeepSORT-Human-Tracking](https://github.com/dasupradyumna/YOLOv7-DeepSORT-Human-Tracking).
